# Transner and doc2txt integration

# Setup virtual environment

In order to install and use the external libraries used in this repository, we recommend the use of a virtual environment.
It can be created using the following command:

```bash
python3 -m venv env
```

You can now activate the virtual environment using the command:

```bash
source env/bin/activate
```

And use ```deactivate``` to disable it.

Once your virtual is activated, you can install the external libraries:

```python
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
